#### Executive Summary 

- Data for this analysis was downloaded from "Human Activity Recognition (HAR)" website. http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har#wle_paper_section
- Test-data was retrieved from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv 
- Training data from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv
- With this data I have tried to build model(s) to predict the type of `movement` of an individual.
- Accelerometers were worn by the `Test-group` to record their movements.
